The distinction is that implements means that you're using the elements of a Java Interface 
in your class, and extends means that you are creating a subclass of the class you are 
extending. You can only extend one class in your new class, but you can implement as many 
interfaces as you would like.

An abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated. It's only purpose is for other 
classes to extend. Abstract methods are methods in the abstract class 
(have to be declared abstract) which means the extending concrete class must override them 
as they have no body.
